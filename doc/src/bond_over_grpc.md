# About #

Bond-over-gRPC provides code generation from Bond IDL service definitions
to send Bond objects via gRPC. The gRPC functionality supercedes the
(now deprecated) Bond Comm framework.

# Features #

## Defining Services ##

The Bond IDL has been extended to support the definition of
[services](compiler.html#service-definition) and
[generic services](compiler.html#generic-service). These definitions are
used by the Bond compiler to generate:

* service stubs that are used as the base for implementing services'
  methods
* proxy stubs that are used by clients to invoke those methods

To generate these stubs, pass the `--grpc` flag to `gbc` (the Bond compiler
tool).

Note that gRPC doesn't provide a messaging pattern that matches
the semantics of methods with a return type of `nothing`; to compensate,
`gbc` provides generated wrappers to simulate the appropriate semantics.

# Implementations #

Bond-over-gRPC is available for C# now and will be released for C++ in a
few weeks.

## Bond-over-gRPC for C# ##

Given a service definition like the following:

    service ExampleService
    {
        ExampleResponse Method(ExampleRequest);
    }

`gbc` will produce stubs for gRPC with the `--grpc` flag:

    gbc c# --grpc example.bond

The service stub allows for the definition of the service implementation like this:

    public class ExampleService : ExampleServiceBase
    {
        public override async Task<IMessage<ExampleResponse>> Method(IMessage<ExampleRequest> param, ServerCallContext context)
        {
            ExampleRequest request = param.Payload.Deserialize();

            // Service business logic

            var response = new ExampleResponse();
            return Message.From(response);
        }
    }

The proxy stub allows the client to invoke the remote service method like this:

    var channel = new Channel("localhost", Port, ChannelCredentials.Insecure);
    var client = new ExampleClient(channel);

    var request = new ExampleRequest();
    IMessage<ExampleResponse> responseMessage = await client.Method(request);
    var response = responseMessage.Payload.Deserialize().Payload;

For more information about gRPC in C#, take a look at the [gRPC C# tutorial](http://www.grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/csharp.html).
Note that the singatures generated by `gbc` are slightly different from the
ones in the gRPC tutorial: on the service side, the request is wrapped in
`IMessage<T>` and on the client side, the response is wrapped in `IMessage<T>`.
This allows for better control over the time of deserialization and also helps
prevent slicing when using polymorphic Bond types.
