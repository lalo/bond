# Bond

Bond is an open source, cross-platform framework for working with schematized
data. It supports cross-language serialization/deserialization and powerful
generic mechanisms for efficiently manipulating data. Bond is broadly used at
Microsoft in high scale services.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: The [Bond Communications framework](https://Microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_comm.html)
-- known as Bond Comm -- is deprecated. We recommend using
[Bond-over-gRPC](https://Microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_over_grpc.html) for communication.
The [Bond Comm C# manual](https://Microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cs.html#bond-comm)
and the [Bond Comm C++ manual](https://Microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cpp.html#bond-comm)
are preserved for transition purposes.**

Bond is published on GitHub at [https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/).

## Dependencies

The Bond repository uses Git submodules and should be cloned with the
`--recursive` flag:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/bond.git
```

In order to build Bond you will need CMake (3.1+), [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) and
Boost (1.58+). Bond's C++ library requires some C++11 features (currently
limited to those supported bv Visual C++ 2013). (Note: Boost 1.59 may not
work with Bond Comm due to some bugs in that version of the Boost ASIO library).

Following are specific instructions for building on various platforms.

### Linux

Bond can be built with Clang (3.4+) or GNU C++ (4.7+). We recommend the latest
version of Clang as it's much faster with template-heavy code like Bond.

Run the following commands to install the minimal set of packages needed to
build the core Bond library on Ubuntu 14.04:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    clang \
    cmake \
    zlib1g-dev \
    libboost-dev \
    libboost-thread-dev
```

In the root `bond` directory run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBOND_ENABLE_GRPC=FALSE
make
sudo make install
```

The `build` directory is just an example. Any directory can be used as the build
destination.

In order to build all the C++ and Python tests and examples, as well as
Bond-over-gRPC, a few more packages are needed, and CMake needs to be run with
different options:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    autoconf \
    build-essential \
    libboost-date-time-dev \
    libboost-python-dev \
    libboost-test-dev \
    libtool \
    python2.7-dev

cd build # or wherever you ran CMake before
cmake .. -DBOND_ENABLE_GRPC=TRUE -DgRPC_ZLIB_PROVIDER=package
```

Running the following command in the build directory will build and execute all
the tests and examples:

```bash
make --jobs 8 check
```

(The unit tests are large so you may want to run 4-8 build jobs in parallel,
assuming you have enough memory.)

### OS X

Install Xcode and then run the following command to install the required
packages using Homebrew ([http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/)):

```bash
brew install \
    cmake \
    haskell-stack \
    boost \
    boost-python
```

(boost-python is optional and only needed for Python support.)

Bond can be built on OS X using either standard \*nix makefiles or Xcode. In
order to generate and build from makefiles, in the root `bond` directory run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

Alternatively, you can generate Xcode projects by passing the `-G Xcode` option
to cmake:

```bash
cmake -G Xcode ..
```

You can build and run unit tests by building the `check` target in Xcode or by
running make in the build directory:

```bash
make --jobs 8 check
```

Note that if you are using Homebrew's Python, you'll need to build
boost-python from source:

```bash
brew install --build-from-source boost-python
```

and tell cmake the location of Homebrew's libpython by setting the
`PYTHON_LIBRARY` variable, e.g.:

```bash
cmake .. \
    -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
```

### Windows

[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7xd2a54x9cwco314/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MicrosoftBond/bond/branch/master)

Install the following tools:

- Visual Studio 2013 or 2015
    - Visual Studio 2015 is required to build C# Bond from source
- CMake ([http://www.cmake.org/download/](http://www.cmake.org/download/))
- Haskell Stack ([https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#windows](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#windows))
- .NET Core SDK ([https://www.microsoft.com/net/core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows))

If you are building on a network behind a proxy, set the environment variable
`HTTP_PROXY`, e.g.:

```bash
set HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy-name:80
```

Now you are ready to build the C# 4.0/4.5 version of Bond. Open the solution
file `cs\cs.sln` in Visual Studio and build as usual. The C# unit tests can
also be run from within the solution.

To build the .NET Core version of Bond, run the build script. The `-Test`
switch is used to run the unit tests as well.

```bash
.\cs\dnc\build -Test
```

The C++ and Python versions of Bond additionally require:

- Boost 1.58+ ([http://www.boost.org/users/download/](http://www.boost.org/users/download/))
- Python 2.7 ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

You may need to set the environment variables `BOOST_ROOT` and `BOOST_LIBRARYDIR`
to specify where Boost and its pre-built libraries for your environment (MSVC 12 or MSVC 14) can be
found, e.g.:

```bash
set BOOST_ROOT=D:\boost_1_58_0
set BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=D:\boost_1_58_0\lib64-msvc-14.0
```

The core Bond library and most examples only require Boost headers. The
pre-built libraries are only needed for unit tests, Python, gRPC, and Comm
support. If Boost or Python libraries are not found on the system, then some
tests and examples will not be built.

In order to generate a solution to build the Bond Core C++ and Python with Visual
Studio 2015 run the following commands from the root `bond` directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
set PreferredToolArchitecture=x64
cmake -DBOND_ENABLE_GRPC=FALSE -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
```

Setting `PreferredToolArchitecture=x64` selects the 64-bit toolchain which
dramatically improves build speed. (The Bond unit tests are too big to build
with 32-bit tools.)

Instead of `cmake` you can also use `cmake-gui` and specify configuration
settings in the UI. This configuration step has to be performed only once. From
then on you can use the generated solution `build\bond.sln` from Visual Studio
or build from command line using `cmake`:

```bash
cmake --build . --target
cmake --build . --target INSTALL
```

In order to build and execute the unit tests and examples run:

```bash
cmake --build . --target check -- /maxcpucount:8
```

To build Bond's gRPC++ integration from source, some of
[gRPC's prerequisites](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#building-using-cmake-with-boringssl)
are also needed:

```bash
choco install activeperl golang ninja yasm
```

You will also need to enable gRPC in the `cmake` configuration step by running the following
in the `build` directory from above and then following the other `cmake` commands above:

```bash
cmake -DBOND_ENABLE_GRPC=TRUE -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
```
