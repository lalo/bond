# This is a workaround for Windows quirks.
# CMake Visual Studio generator translates add_custom_command into a batch file
# embedded in Visual Studio project. Batch files have problems with paths that
# contain non-ascii characters because they are limited to DOS encoding. It so
# happens that stack is quite likely to be installed in such a path because by
# default stack install uses directory under %APPDATA% which contains user name.
# As a workaround we execute this .cmake script as a custom command and use CMake
# cache to get access to variables set during configuration.

# Get proper behavior for if condition with error variable
